## üìù Introduction  
Welcome to my **Investment Portfolio Analysis**, where I‚Äôve harnessed my data analytics skills to tackle a real-world challenge: helping investors navigate the **risk vs. return trade-off**.  

As an aspiring data professional eager to make an impact, I‚Äôve built this project using **Python, SQL, and Power BI** to answer a key question:  

*üëâ Which portfolio offers the best balance between growth and downside protection?*  

By analyzing **10 years of ETF data**, I‚Äôve created a practical tool to deliver actionable insights‚Äîperfect for kickstarting a career in **data analysis** or **finance**.  

---

## üéØ Purpose  
This project addresses a common investor dilemma by comparing portfolio strategies (e.g., **60/40, All Weather, Permanent, Golden Butterfly**) to identify the best balance of **growth and downside protection**.  

It demonstrates my ability to **process financial data** and provide meaningful insights, making it a strong showcase for **entry-level data analysis or finance roles**.  

---

## üîé Overview  
This project:  
- Fetches **~10 years of daily ETF data** (SPY, AGG, TLT, etc.) from Yahoo Finance with Python.  
- Calculates **returns, CAGR, volatility, Sharpe Ratio, max drawdowns**.  
- Rebalances portfolios every **21 trading days (~monthly)**.  
- Stores results in **CSV files** and a **SQLite database** (SQL queries included for demonstration).  
- Visualizes results in an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.  

üìÖ Example dataset covered: *September 18, 2015 ‚Üí September 12, 2025*.

## üìå Questions Answered  
- What is the **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)** for each strategy over 10 years?  
- Which portfolio has the **highest Sharpe Ratio** (risk-adjusted return, 1% risk-free)?  
- What is the **maximum drawdown** for each strategy compared to SPY?  
- How do **diversified portfolios** balance growth vs resilience?

### üîπ Detailed Descriptions  

<details>
<summary>üìÇ Expand to read portfolio details</summary>  

- **60/40 Portfolio**  
  - **Intent**: Balance of growth and stability.

**‚úÖ How they differ despite overlap**:  
- **All-Weather** = macro-hedged, designed to respond to economic forces.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How I Worked to Find the Results  

### Step 1: Data Extraction and Processing (Python)  
- Used `yfinance` to download adjusted closing prices for ETFs.  
- Calculated daily returns and cumulative values with Pandas and NumPy.  

<details>
<summary>üìú Example data extraction snippet</summary>

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
from datetime import date, timedelta

tickers = ["SPY", "AGG", "TLT", "GLD", "DBC", "IEF", "SHY", "BIL", "VBR", "VV"]
start_date = date.today() - timedelta(days=365*10)
end_date = date.today()

data = yf.download(tickers, start=start_date, end=end_date, auto_adjust=True)["Close"]
df_daily_returns = data.pct_change()
```
</details> 

---

### Step 2: Portfolio Calculation and Metrics  
- Rebalanced portfolios every 21 trading days (approximately monthly) using a custom function.  
- Computed metrics: CAGR, Annual Volatility, Sharpe Ratio (risk-free rate = 1%), and Maximum Drawdown.

<details>
<summary>üìú Example CAGR Calculation</summary>

```python
for etf in df_compound_values.columns:
    wealth = df_compound_values[etf]
    total_return = wealth.iloc[-1] - 1
    days = (wealth.index[-1] - wealth.index[0]).days
    years = days / 365.25 
    CAGR = (wealth.iloc[-1]) ** (1/years) - 1
```
</details> 


---

### Step 3: Data Storage and Querying (SQL)  
- Stored results in CSV files and a SQLite database (with SQL queries to demonstrate my skills, not critical to the analysis).  
- Used SQL to extract sample insights.  

<details>
<summary>üìú Example SQL Query</summary>
  
```sql
-- Average CAGR
SELECT PRINTF('%.2f%%', AVG(CAGR) * 100) AS AVERAGE_CAGR
FROM portfolio_metrics
WHERE name IN ("SPY", "Golden_Butterfly", "60_40", "All_Weather", "Permanent");
```
</details>

---

### Step 4: Visualization (Power BI)  
- Imported CSV data into Power BI.  
- Built a data model with table relationships.  
- Created charts and visualizations using Power BI, with metrics pre-computed in Python, and used DAX for the interactive features I developed.  
- The dashboard features interactivity with clickable metrics, dynamically displaying the best and worst portfolios by selected metric, enhancing user engagement and insight.

        "CAGR", MAX('portfolio_metrics'[CAGR]),
        "Max Drawdown", MAX('portfolio_metrics'[MaxDrawdown]),
        "Sharpe Ratio", MAX('portfolio_metrics'[Sharpe]),
        "Volatility", MIN('portfolio_metrics'[Annual Volatility])
    )
RETURN BestValue
```

## üìà Findings  

Based on a sample run from **September 18, 2015 ‚Üí September 12, 2025**  
*(note: dates will vary with current run as of September 18, 2025; results may shift in different periods but reflect general trends over this decade)*:  

- **Average CAGR**: **8.71%** across key portfolios, showing how diversification tempers SPY's high **14.81%** growth to more sustainable levels, though at the cost of upside in bull markets.  
- **Best Sharpe Ratio**: **Permanent Portfolio (0.91)** ‚Äì fulfills its promise of wealth preservation with a **CAGR 7.52%**, **Volatility 7.17%**, and **Max Drawdown -17.51%**, delivering radical balance and efficiency.  
- **Worst Max Drawdown**: **SPY (-33.72%)** ‚Äì aligns with its pure growth intent but exposes the **Volatility 18.09%** and **Sharpe 0.80** trade-off for uncushioned upside.  

**Diversification Benefit (judged against promises):**  
- **60/40**: Meets its balance of growth and stability with a **CAGR 9.89%**, **Sharpe 0.81**, **Volatility 11.17%**, and **Max Drawdown -20.91%**. Provides straightforward exposure but without superior adjusted returns over SPY.  
- **Permanent**: Excels in its *‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù* simplicity, offering **resilient performance** across assets with minimal tinkering.  
- **Golden Butterfly**: Achieves its ambitious evolution of Permanent by boosting **CAGR 8.35%**, **Sharpe 0.85**, **Volatility 8.67%**, and **Max Drawdown -18.84%**. Enhances growth while preserving safety.  
- **All Weather**: Falls short of thriving in all environments, with a **CAGR 6.33%**, **Volatility 8.73%**, **Sharpe 0.63**, and **Max Drawdown -23.53%**‚Äîthe second-worst after SPY‚Äîdue to long-term bond (TLT) underperformance in this rate-sensitive era.  

**Key Insight**:  
**Permanent** and **Golden Butterfly** deliver on their promises of efficiency and balanced ambition, **outperforming in risk-adjusted terms**; **60/40** provides reliable stability akin to SPY but with less volatility; **All Weather's macro-hedge faltered**, highlighting bond risks‚Äî**diversification tempers extremes**, guiding investors to strategies matching their tolerance.

## üöÄ Future Improvements  

- Experiment with **different rebalancing periods** (monthly, quarterly, yearly) to assess impact on results.  
- Analyze **correlation with SPY** and **beta** to assess diversification effectiveness.  
- Calculate **time to recover from drawdowns** for each portfolio.  
- Add **interactivity** to the Power BI dashboard, allowing users to select different starting and ending points to see how metrics (CAGR, Sharpe Ratio, etc.) change dynamically.  
- Optimize **Python code** for additional robustness and performance.

## üíª How to See and Reproduce It  

- **View on GitHub**: Browse files directly‚Äîcheck `powerbi/` for screenshots, `notebooks/` for code, and `data/` for results. All files are publicly downloadable, but opening them requires compatible software (e.g., Power BI Desktop for `.pbix`, Jupyter for `.ipynb`).  

- **Reproduce Locally**:  
  1. Download the repo: Click ‚ÄúCode‚Äù > ‚ÄúDownload ZIP.‚Äù  
  2. Install dependencies: Run `pip install pandas numpy yfinance sqlite3` in your Python environment.  
  3. Run the notebook: Open `portfolio_analysis.ipynb` in Google Colab (preferred for easy setup) or Jupyter Notebook and execute cells to generate data. Note that the start date will be approximately 10 years before today (e.g., around September 15, 2015, as of now) and the end date will be today, differing from the showcased run (September 15, 2015, to September 12, 2025).  
  4. View Power BI: Check `powerbi/` screenshots or import `powerbi/portfolio_analysis.pbix` (if uploaded) into Power BI Desktop.
